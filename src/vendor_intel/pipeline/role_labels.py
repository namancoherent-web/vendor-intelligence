"""Lightweight market-role labelling, run inside the pipeline.

ONE vocabulary call + batched (sequential) assignment over the exported companies. Gives each
company a CLEAR market-specific role (e.g. 'Re-Refiner', 'Base-Oil Offtaker', 'Antenna OEM') and
a FUNCTIONALITY phrase describing how it is aligned to / serves the market. Also flags clearly
off-market companies so they can be dropped.

Deliberately minimal (~10-15 Haiku calls/run, no concurrency) so it never pressures the API the
way the earlier multi-pass enrichment did.
